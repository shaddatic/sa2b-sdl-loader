# SASDL for SA2
SASDL is a simple, common interface mod for the SDL2 library. It abstracts the loading, init, and event handling so mods that wish to use SDL2 can do so more easily and without conflicting with each other. This mod does nothing on its own.

## Installation
Download the files and decompress them into your game's `mods` folder, or use Game Banana's '1-Click Install' feature to handle this for you. There is no specific placement needed for this mod, but higher is usually better for dependencies.

## Making New Issues
If you know of an issue that can be fixed by this mod, please feel free to make a new GitHub issue after checking it's not already been made. But remember, it's one issue per GitHub issue. Any issues after the first will be ignored, please make seperate entries for the others.
